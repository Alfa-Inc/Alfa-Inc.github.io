Make sure to replace star_wars_logo.png with the actual path to your Star Wars logo, and loading_icon.gif with an animated loading icon of your choice.

Feel free to modify this code further to suit your needs, such as adding additional Star Wars-themed animations or customizing the styling to match the Star Wars aesthetic.
